# AVL Trees

## Introduction
- Binary Search Trees can be unbalanced.
- To be balance, we refer to trees in which all nodes have depth around *log(n)* or less.
- One side can have way more nodes than the other side.
- AVL trees is one solution. This is done by rotating nodes.
- Shorten one side and lengthen the other. This makes the tree more even.
- We explore a type of  self-balancing binary search tree called **AVL Trees**.
