# Hash Maps
- Arrays have easy access if we know what index to look for.
- However, if we are looking for something, it can be difficult to find out exactly what element in the array contains that value.
- Our solution is **Hash Maps**.
- We run values through formulas that converts what we are storing into a number.
- Take the modulo of that number based on the size of our array.
- This is therefore the index into our array.
- Can have duplicate indices.
- If done right, we can read/write in constant time.

## Introduction
- Insertion and lookup (sometimes removal) is done efficiently by the map data type.
- Known also as *dictionary* or an *associative array*.
