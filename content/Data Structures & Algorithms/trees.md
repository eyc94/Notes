# Trees

## Introduction
- Trees can be a data structure, but we can also organize data into trees within other data structures.
- Trees have roots that branch to 0 or more nodes until you reach the end (leaf).
- There are Binary Trees where every node has at most 2 child nodes.
- There are Binary Search Trees (BSTs) that have a special property.
    - All values to the left of the node are smaller.
    - All values to the right of the node are larger or equal to.
    - The "equal to" condition can be on the left or right side.
