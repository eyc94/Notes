# Trees

## Introduction
- Trees start at roots that branch to 0 or more nodes until you reach the end node (a leaf).
- There are Binary Trees where every node has at most 2 child nodes.
- There are Binary Search Trees (BSTs) that have special properties.
    - All values to the left of the node are smaller.
    - All values to the right of the node are larger or equal to.
    - The "equal to" condition can be on the left or right side.
