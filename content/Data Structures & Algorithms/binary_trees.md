# Binary Trees

## Introduction
- Each node in a tree can have at most two children.
    - These nodes are labeled as left child and right child.
- We can talk about a node's left subtree as the subtree rooted at that node's left child.
- We can talk about a node's right subtree as the subtree rooted at that node's right child.
