# Binary Trees

## Introduction
- Each node in a tree can have at most two children.
    - These nodes are labeled as left child and right child.
- We can talk about a node's left subtree as the subtree rooted at that node's left child.
- We can talk about a node's right subtree as the subtree rooted at that node's right child.

## States of Binary Trees

#### Full Binary Tree
- Every interior node has exactly two children.

#### Perfect Binary Tree
- A Full Binary Tree where all the leaves are at the same depth.
    - It has ```2<sup>h</sup>``` leaves (where h is the height).
    - It has ```2<sup>h+1</sup> - 1``` total nodes (where h is the height).
