# Activity-Selection Problem

- Scheduling several competing activities that require exclusive use of a common resource, with a goal of maximum-size set of mutually compatible activities.
- Suppose we have a set *S = {a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>,..., a<sub>n</sub>}* of *n* proposed **activities** that wish to use a resource, such as a lecture hall, which can only serve one activity at a time.
- Each activity *a<sub>i</sub>* has a **start time** *s<sub>i</sub>* and a **finish time** *f<sub>i</sub>*, where 0 ≤ *s<sub>i</sub>* < *f<sub>i</sub>* < ∞.
