# Divide & Conquer

- Divide & Conquer (D&C) is a top-down algorithm design technique based on multi-branched recursion.
- A D&C algorithm works by recursively breaking down a problem into two or more sub-problems of the same or related type, until these become simple enough to be solved directly.
- The solutions to the sub-problems are then combined to give a solution to the original problem.

- When subproblems are large enough to solve recursively, we call that the **recursive case**.
- When they become small enough that you cannot recurse, it bottoms out and we call that the **base case**.

## Recurrences
- Goes hand in hand with D&C.
