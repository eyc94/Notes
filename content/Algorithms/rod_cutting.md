# Rod Cutting

- The **rod-cutting problem** is the following.
    - Given a rod of length *n* inches and a table of prices *p<sub>i</sub>* for *i* = 1, 2, ..., n, determine the maximum revenue *r<sub>n</sub>* obtainable by cutting up the rod and selling the pieces.

- Consider the case when *n* = 4.
- Figure below shows all the ways to cut up a rod of 4 inches in length, including the way with no cuts at all.
