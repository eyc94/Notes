# Insertion Sort
- Input comes in the form of an array with *n* elements.
- Efficient for sorting a small number of elements.
- It's like sorting a hand of playing cards.
    - Start with an empty left hand.
    - Cards are face down on table.
    - Grab one card at a time and place in left hand.
    - If left hand has cards, compare picked up card to cards in left hand from right to left and put the picked up card in proper place.
    - Left hand is always sorted.
