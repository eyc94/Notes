# Greedy Algorithms

- Solve optimization problems.
- Works by making the decision that seems the "best" or "most optimal" at any moment.
    - Never reconsiders this decision.
- Simple & straightforward.
- However, they are shortsighted because they make these decisions based on a "local optimal" rather than a "global optimal".
- Easy to design and implement.
- Efficient most of the times.
- Many problems cannot be solved **correctly** by the greedy approach.
- Important to determine which problems can be solved by a greedy approach.
