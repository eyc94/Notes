# Greedy Algorithms

- Solve optimization problems.
- Usually DP is overkill, simpler algorithms will do.
- Works by making the decision that seems the "best" or "most optimal" at any moment.
    - Never reconsiders this decision.
- Simple & straightforward.
- Makes a locally optimal choice in the hope that this choice will lead to a globally optimal solution.
- Easy to design and implement.
- Efficient most of the times.
- Many problems cannot be solved **correctly** by the greedy approach.
- Important to determine which problems can be solved by a greedy approach.

## Some problems
- Knapsack
- Activity Selection/Scheduling
- Job Scheduling
- Coin Change Making
- Huffman Codes
