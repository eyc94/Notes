# Kruskal's Algorithm
- Elaborates on the generic method.
- Uses a specific rule to determine a safe edge in line 3 of the generic method.
- The set *A* is a forest whose vertices are all those of the given graph. Safe edge added to *A* is always a least-weight edge in the graph that connects two distinct components.
