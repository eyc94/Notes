# Longest Increasing Subsequence
- The **Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)** problem is to find the length of the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that all elements of the subsequence are sorted in increasing order.

- Two recursive backtracking algorithms for this problem runs in O(2<sup>N</sup>) in the worst case.
- Both can be sped up using DP.
